About the Data
 


The dataset was pre-processed and analyzed to remove redundant attributes. Then,classifiers like Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbour were experimented for the task of predicting the Salary Status. The experimental results show that the Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 84.98%. Whereas, the K-Nearest Neighbour classifier had an accuracy of 82.94%
